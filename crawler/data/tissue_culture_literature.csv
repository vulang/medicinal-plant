Method: Young shoots of A. aspera and A. bidentata were harvested and washed with running tap water and treated with 0.1% bavistin and rinsed twice with distilled water. Then the explants were surface sterilized with 0.1%(w/v)HgCl2 solutions for 1 min. After rinsing with sterile distilled water for 3-4 times, nodal segments were cut into smaller segments(1 cm) and used as the explants. The explants were placed horizontally as well as vertically on solid basal Murashige and Skoog(MS) medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, 0.6%(w/v)agar(Hi-Media, Mumbai) and different concentration and combination of 6-benzyl amino purine(BAP), kinetin(Kin), naphthalene acetic acid(NAA) and indole acetic acid(IAA) for direct regeneration. Results: Adventitious proliferation was obtained from A. aspera and A. bidentata nodal segments inoculated on MS basal medium with 3% sucrose and augmented with BAP and Kin with varied frequency. MS medium augmented with 3.0 mg/L of BAP showed the highest percentage (93.60±0.71) of shootlets formation for A. aspera and (94.70±0.53) percentages for A. bidentata. Maximum number of shoots/explants (10.60±0.36) for A. aspera and (9.50±0.56) for A. bidentata was observed in MS medium fortified with 5.0 mg/L of BAP. For A. aspera, maximum mean length (5.50±0.34) of shootlets was obtained in MS medium augmented with 3.0 mg/L of Kin and for A. bidentata (5.40±0.61) was observed in the very same concentraion. The highest percentage, maximum number of rootlets/shootlet and mean length of rootlets were observed in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L of IBA. Seventy percentages of plants were successfully established in polycups. Sixty eight percentages of plants were well established in the green house condition. Sixty five percentages of plants were established in the field. Conclusions: The results have shown that use of nodal buds is an alternative reproducible and dependable method for clonal propagation of A. aspera and A. bidentata. The high rate of direct shoot-root multiplication and thier high rate of post-hardening survival indicate that this protocol can be easily adopted for commercial large scale cultivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cinnamon bark oil contains no less than 90 identified compounds and over 50 very minute unidentified compounds. The mild and mellow aroma of both cinnamon bark and cassia oils is due to the synergistic effect of all these compounds. Food technologists and food manufacturers find it very difficult to imitate them completely with synthetic substitutes. Although cinnamaldehyde gives a very crude imitation of either cinnamon or cassia, it is nowhere near the natural flavour. Now a days the synthetic essential oils are rejected by leading food manufacturers. There has always been a demand for natural cinnamon and cassia. Since these plants are naturally cross pollinated, variation arises among the progenies. According to the statistics of the Spices Board, Govt. of India, the area under cinnamon and cassia cultivation in Kerala is 326 hectares during 2005-2006. The import of cinnamon and cassia to India was 11313.5 t during 2005-2006. The export of cinnamon and cassia from India during 2006-2007 was 304.9 t, and cinnamon and cassia in powder form was 406.5 t. The export of cinnamon and cassia oil was 9.4 t and cinnamon and cassia oleoresin was 17.9 t during 2006-2007. The import of cinnamon and cassia oil to India was 19.7 t during 2006-2007.The shortage of adequate planting material of elite trees is a major problem for cinnamon propagation. A few dozen elite cultivars obtained through selection possess considerable market relevance. However, conventional breeding methods are extremely time consuming because they depend on cross pollination, seed germination and selection as well as vegetative regeneration. The major drawback of seed propagation is that, cinnamon being a cross-pollinated plant, exhibits wide variability in yield, quality of produce and oil content and other morphological characteristics. Modern plant biotechnology has adequate potential to reduce the time needed for traditional breeding programmes and to multiply adequate propagules that will have the same genetic make up as the mother plant within a short time. Thus it helps in maintaining uniformity within the population. Major emphasis in the present study was given in multiplying the commonly used cinnamon, Cinnamomum verum, while C. cassia has been used only for preliminary experimentation in order to find its in vitro responses for comparison.",Standardization of micropropagation protocols for Cinnamomum verum and Cinnamomum cassia,"Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum Berchthold and Presl) trees and seedlings grown at Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR) campus, Calicut, Kerala, were selected as the source of explants.",Shoot tips and nodal segments of Cinnamomum cassia,"Shoot tips and nodal segments of Cinnamomum cassia were used for the initial establishment of cultures.

We examined the effects of changes in growth conditions (type of tube closure, light, and sugar levels) on the development of photoautotrophy and growth during micropropagation and sought to establish whether they affected later acclimation to conditions ex vitro. During the two stages in vitro, plantlets were grown in tubes under two different PPFD (50 and 110umol/m/s), in media with three different sucrose concentrations (0, 1.5, and 3.0%, w/v) and with two different CO2 levels inside the tubes (controlled by either tightly closed caps or loosely sealed caps, and with an external CO2 concentration of 750 umol/mol). The development of photoautotrophy was assessed by determining the difference between the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of sugar cane sucrose used as a heterotrophic carbon source and that of leaflets grown in vitro. Plantlets from the root-induction stage showed a more highly developed photoautotrophy than those from the shoot- multiplication stage. At both stages, utilization of closed caps was the treatment which most stimulated development of photoautotrophy in plantlets. Also, lowering PPFD or sucrose concentration induced a greater degree of photoautotrophic development, the strongest effect being observed in plantlets cultured inside loosely sealed tubes. During acclimation ex vitro, plantlets taken from loosely sealed tubes in vitro performed better than those cultured inside tightly sealed tubes. The former, as well as recording a larger increase in fresh weight during this stage, also showed more negative δ13C in the newly developed leaves, which would seem to indicate a better water status during acclimation.

An auxin / cytokinin combination was required for regeneration. TDZ was the most effective cytokinin, while NAA was more effective than IAA or 2,4-D.Optimum conditions for regeneration from explants (leaf,stem and root) of cv. WSP-3, evaluated in terms of regeneration frequency and number of regenerated shoots per explant, were TDZ and NAA in combination, 5 - 10 mg/1 and 0.1 mg/l for leaf and stem explants, and 10 mg/l and 1 mg/l for root explants, respectively.

The presence of an auxin was required, as no regeneration was obtained with cytokinin alone. In order to establish optimum conditions for regeneration, TDZ was used in combination with three auxins. NAA was the most effective for regeneration from leaf explants at 0.1 mg/L when combined with 5-10 mg/L TDZ (regeneration frequency, 100%). Although 100% regeneration frequency was also attained on MS medium containing 20 mg/L TDZ along with 0.1 mg/L NAA and 1 mg/L IAA, some of the shoots were vitreous, which hindered subsequent rooting and acclimation. 2,4-D was the least suitable. Regeneration from stem and root explants was greatest at 5-10 mg/L TDZ in combination with 0.1 mg/L NAA, and at 10 mg/L TDZ in combination with 1 mg/L NAA, respectively. For root explants, only five adventitious shoots per explant were formed which is less than under the optimum conditions for leaf and stem explants.

Between the two cytoknins, BA was more effective and induced a higher number of shoots per explant compared to Kin. The maximum average number of multiple shoots (9.1 shoots/explant) could be induced in shoot apices on 1/2 MS supplemented with 2.0 mg/L BA, 3% sucrose and 0.9% agar, followed by 8.8 shoots/explant on medium with 1.0 mg/L BA. There was an inverse correlation between concentrations of both BA and Kin and lengths of induced shoots. Average shoot elongation was higher (2.82 and 3.56 cm) at lower concentrations of BA (0.1 mg /L) and Kin (0.1 mg /L), respectively.","On culture of in vitro derived shoots on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with a range of concentrations of two auxins (NAA and 3-indolebutyric acid: IBA) for 8 weeks, it was observed that the lower concentrations of NAA or IBA resulted in a higher number as well as better root/shoot growth. NAA at 0.1 mg/L induced the greater number of roots (37.2) and fresh weight (1.55 g) in comparison to IBA at 0.1 mg/L which induced a lesser number of roots (25.8) and lesser fresh weight (1.20 g). Higher concentrations of IBA and NAA (1.0 mg/L) reduced the number and length of roots as compared to 0.1 mg/L concentration. In contrast to culture obtained from Taiwan Sugar Corporation, roots induced in the MS medium supplemented with NAA 0.1 mg/L were multifold and robust. A supplement of 1.0 mg/L NAA in the MS stimulated callus induction, a trait undesirable for health of roots/shoots and ex vitro survival of plantlets. Between the two sets of ventilation closure treatments, i.e. one-stage and two-stage with a total incubation period of 8 weeks, overall, all the root/shoot growth parameters including the plant survival percentage were higher with two-stage ventilation closure treatments. There were significant differences in root/shoot growth parameters among the treatments within the one-stage, and twostage ventilation closures itself. Among the one-stage ventilation closure treatments,the maximum number of roots (20.20), root length (4.58 cm), shoot length (2.23 cm), fresh weight (1.09 g) and plant survival percentage (94.44) was achieved with 2AF8wk, i.e. when culture vessels were closed with 2 layers of aluminum foil and incubation for 8 weeks. In contrast to aluminum foil, there was an overall decrease in root/shoot growth parameters when culture vessels were closed with 2, 3 and 4 dispense papers. Among the three DP treatments, the maximum number of roots (18), root length (3.78 cm), shoot length (1.51 cm), fresh weight (0.94 g) and plant survival percentage (91.67) was achieved with 4DP8wk, i.e. when culture vessels were closed with 4 layers of dispense paper and incubation for 8 weeks. There was no drastic difference in root/shoot growth parameters and plant survival percentage in the ventilation closure treatment 4H2AF8wk, i.e. 2AF with 4 holes punched in the center and covered with air permeable tape. Among the 4 two-stage ventilation closure treatments, the maximum number of roots (33.7), root length (5.89 cm), fresh weight (1.41 g) and plant survival (96%) were obtained with treatment 2AF4wk/4DP4wk, i.e. when culture vessels were closed with 2 AF for 4 weeks and then AF replaced by 4DP for the next 4 weeks.","After 8 weeks of incubation under the ventilation closure conditions, the plantlets were carefully taken out of culture vessels and rinsed gently with running tap water to remove traces of agar. The plantlets were then blotted dry on paper towel and their fresh weights, number of shoots and roots, length of roots and shoots were recorded. Thereafter, plantlets were briefly treated with 0.1% Benlate (a systemic fungicide) solution (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) and transplanted into plastic pots containing a mixture of peatmoss:perlite:vermiculite (2:1:1 v/v). For acclimatization, each potted plant was covered with a transparent polyethylene sachet. After one week, a small hole was made in a corner of each sachet, and another hole was made in the opposite corner after 2 weeks. The top corners on both sides of each sachet were cut open after 3 weeks, and sachets were completely removed after 4 weeks. Thereafter, these were shifted to the University’s greenhouse. The plants were irrigated every day with tap water. The plant survival against each ventilation closure treatment was recorded after 2 months. Between the one-stage and two-stage ventilation closure treatments, the overall survival percentages were higher (90–96) in the two-stage treatments. The maximum survival percentage (96) was recorded with the twostage treatment 2AF4wk/4DP4wk, i.e. culture vessel closed with 2 layers of aluminum foil for first 4 weeks and then AF replaced with 4 layers of disense paper. Covering of plants with transparent polyethylene sachets for the first 4 weeks and its gradual exposure to the ambient conditions was supportive of acclimatization process and gave rise to higher plantlet survival percentages.

Few cases of induction or elongation of stolons using GA3 treatments were observed as well as abnormal stolon morphologies and enlarged stolon buds (0.01μM GA3) and thin stolons (1 and 10 μM). To examine the effects of NAA on the proliferation of cultured stolon, the stolons (2–3 cm long, 10 segments/bottle, total 2 g fresh weight) were inoculated (as before) into MS liquid medium containing 3% sucrose and NAA (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10μM) in polycarbonate culture bottles and cultured as mentioned above.

For triterpenoid and sterol in cultured stolons：Sterol and triterpenol quantifications were carried out using previously described methods (Ohyama et al. 2007). Oleanolic acid and betulinic acid were quantified using standard calibration curves with coefficients of determination, r2>0.999. The curves were constructed using the peak area ratio (m/z 482) of TMS derivatives. After drying, water and 1% NH3 eluents were analyzed using LC/MS; a mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar, API) connected to an HPLC (1100 series, Agilent Technologies) for identifications. For glycyrrhizin identification, LC/MS analyses were performed with two solvent systems and with both negative and positive ion scans. For HPLC, SenshuPak ODS-II 25 cm×0.2 mm column with a flow rate of 0.2 ml min-1 were used. System 1: Eluent A was 0.1% (w/v) acetic acid in acetonitrile; eluent B was 0.1% (w/v) acetic acid in water.

Callus was readily induced from stem without node and petiole explants within 2 days of culture but failed to generate shoots. Adventitious shoots were successfully produced from meristematic regions only: bud eyes on nodal stem sections, and junctions of petioles and petiolules. No shoots were induced from internode sections, petiole without junctions, or leaf sections. Nodal sections were the most efficient explants. There were up to 20 shoots in one explant generated within 20 days of culture. TDZ was more effective than BA to induce shoots. The 100% shoot induction rate was obtained in medium containing 0.1–3 mg/L of TDZ. However, higher concentrations of TDZ inhibited shoot elongation and only large leaf clusters were produced. Combinations of BA and TDZ failed to increase shoot induction rates but caused shoots shorter. The 2–60-min pretreatment of explants with 20 mg/L TDZ solution was very effective to induce adventitious shoots directly, but both shoot number and shoot length tended to decrease as treatment time increased. GA3 was beneficial for shoot and stem elongation.",Themajor goal of this study is to find the best combination of young vegetative explants and PGR’s for shoot induction from P. lactiflora. This research would be an enabling step in propagation of true-to-type cultivars in commercial laboratories.,"Three cultivars of herbaceous peony were investigated in this study: ‘Xi Shi Fen’ (‘XSF’), ‘Yang Fei Chu Yu’ (‘YFCY’) and ‘Fen Ling Hong Zhu’ (‘FLHZ’).","Five types of explants from elongated young shoots were evaluated including stem sections (5–8 mm long) with or without nodes, petioles (5 mm long) without junction, fork petioles (5–8 mm long) consisting of top main-petiole section and basal sections of three petiolules, and sections (16–25 mm2) of young leaves (unexpanded or just expanded).","Young elongated shoots were washed in tap water three times and cut into 2-4 cm long sections. Sections were soaked in 70% ethanol for 8-10s followed by 15 min of sterilization with 10% commercial Bleach, to which Tween 20 (1 drop per 100 mL) was added. Plant material wes rinsed three times for 5 min in autoclaved distilled water. After sterilization, explants were cut into shoeter sections (3-8 mm); inoculated on Petri dishes, and moved to 25 mm × 95 mm tubes or small plastic culture jars after initial culture. Culture vesseles were maintained under cool fluorescence light, 60 lx, with a 16 h light cycle at 25 ± 1℃. Experiment 1: the response of five explant types of 'XSF' to different plant growth regulators (PGRs) were evaluated on medium (1) a half strength Murashige and Skoog medium (1/2MS) + 1 mg L-1 benzylaminopurine (BA) + 0.1 mg L-1 gibberellic acid (GA3); (2) 1/2MS + 0.1 mg L-1 BA + 1 mg L-1 GA3; (3) 1/2MS + 1 mg L-1 BA + 3 mg L-1 thidiazuron (TDZ); and (4) 1/2MS + 1 mg L-1 BA + 3 mg L-1 TDZ + 1 mg L-1 GA3. Exreriment 2: four types of explants (except petiole with junction) from 'YFCY' and 'FLHZ' were used to evaluate their shoot induction ability in 1/2MS medium with the following concentrations of TDZ: (1) 0 mg L-1 as control; (2) 0.1 mg L-1; (3) 0.5 mg L-1; (4) 1 mg L-1; and (5) 3 mg L-1. After 12 days of culture, explants were transferred to fresh medium with 1/2 MS + 1 mg L-1 GA3. Experiment3: four explants (except leaf) of 'XSF' was pretreated with high concentration TDZ at 20 mg L-1 (90 µM) for (1) 2 min; (2) 15 min; or (3) 60 min at 25℃. The explants were then inoculated onto full strength PGR-free MS medium. After 15 days of culture, explants were transferred to the fresh medium with 1/2MS + 0.1 mg L-1 BA + 1 mg L-1 GA3 or medium with 1/2MS + 1 mg L-1 GA3.","Culture conditions were indicated above. Young nodal stems were the most efficient explants for shoot induction with nearly 100% shoot induction rate obtained. Each node can produce several to over 20 shoots in 20 days. Addition of BA to medium resulted in shoot induction of peony. A higher concentration (1 mg L-1) of BA was more effective than a lower concentration (0.1 mg L-1). Application of TDZ to BA-containing medium did not significantly increase shooting rate but made shoots visually shorter and stronger. GA3 had a significant effect on shoot elongation, but shoots induced on medium with high GA3 concentrations were thin and too weak for root induction. TDZ showed very strong shoot induction ability and 100% shooting rate (the number of explants with induced shoots/the number of inoculated explants) was obtained on the nodal segments of 'YFCY' with treatments of TDZ ranging from 0.1 to 3 mg L-1. Shooting rates of 'FLHZ' were low. Shooting rate of 'FLHZ' also decreased at TDZ concentration larger than 0.5 mg L-1. Pretreatment with high concentration of TDZ inhibited stem elongation of induced shoots significantly and resulted in larger leaf clusters after transfer to shoot elongation medium (1/2MS + 0.1 mg L-1 BA + 1 mg L-1 GA3). TDZ shock treatment (a short-time treatment with very high concentration of TDZ compared with the normal usage) of 'XSF' resulted in same shoot induction rates for the same type of explants. Treatments with 2, 15 or 60 min of 20 mg L-1 TDZ soak resulted in 100% shooting rates for explants of both nodal stems and folk petioles. Although fork petioles also showed higher shoot-induction ability after shock treatment with high concentrations of TDZ, the induced shoot primordia were difficult to form normal shoots, and only three shoots at most could be produced on a segment. No differences in shoot number and shoot length of 'XSF' was observed between shock treatments although longer shock treatment of 20 mg L-1 TDZ tended to inhibit the number and elongation of adventitious shoots. Other experiments showed that normal elongated shoots could be obtained from nodal stem sections of 'XSF' even if explants were treated with 20 mg L-1 TDZ at 8℃ for 10 h.",The roots were obtained on semisolid medium or by paper bridge method (liquid medium) with IBA in later experiments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of an auxin to the medium caused a significant increase in the incidence of hyperhydricity compared with the control. The highest multiplication rate (2.40) and the lowest incidence of hyperhydricity (7.01%) were observed on auxin- free medium (0.2 mg L-1 BA + 0.1 mg L-1 GA3).

Its major problem during in vitro culture is leaching out of phenols in the medium. It causes hindrance in growth and development. Rooting is a complex process and main step for vegetative propagation. The main objective is to propagate this plant and produce multiple copies and understand rooting phenomenon which is usually complicated. Methods: The underground rhizomatous buds of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. ‘Hortensis’ were selected as the explants. In vitro micropropagation was carried out along with biochemical studies during rooting process. Results: Shoot induction, axillary shoot proliferation and rooting were established. The best initial medium for ‘hortensis’ was the half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (double-strength Ca+2) supplemented with 1 mg L-1 N6 benzyl-adenine (BA) and 0.5 mg L-1 Gibberellic Acid (GA3). Shoot induction was 100% with 6.2 shoots per explant. Rooting was also observed on the half-strength MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg L-1 Indole-3-butyric Acid (IBA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The highest percentage of rooting (15%) was observed when in vitro shoots were dipped in the full-strength liquid MS medium supplemented with 10.0 mg L-1 IBA without agar for five days and then transferred to the quarter strength MS medium without any Plant Growth Regulator (PGR). Conclusion: The cultivar P. lactiflora hortensis is hard to root in vitro.

The outer scales were peeled off and buds were soaked in 70% (v/v) ethanol (Yakuri Pure Chemicals, Kyoto, Japan) for 5 min and then rinsed with distilled water. After this, they were soaked in 1.5% (v/v) NaOCl (Yakuri Pure Chemicals, Kyoto, Japan) for 5 min and the rinsed with distilled water. Under aseptic conditions, 3-5 scales were removed and treated with 70% (v/v) ethanol and 1.5% (v/v) NaOCl for 5 min each and then rinsed with sterile distilled water thrice. All sterilized buds were cultured on the medium (1/2MS salts, vitamins, double-strength CaCl2, 3% sucrose and plant growth regulators (PGRs), solidified with 0.8% agar, 0.1% w/v activated charcoal, 50 mL medium/300 mL Magenta box, 1 bud/box, 25±2℃, 16 h photoperiod: 30 µmol m-2sec-1 PPFD). The effect of giberellic acid (GA3), N6-benzyl-adenine (BA), Kinetin (Kin), Indole-3-butyric Acid (IBA) and Indole-3-acetic Acid (IAA) was tried on initiation culture of ‘hortensis’. Their effect was observed on shoot induction and proliferation of cultures. The surface sterilization method helped to produce 85% aseptic cultures. After inoculation of underground rhizomatous buds on the medium, they grew quickly within 15 days with 4-5 leaves. These buds sprouted out into main shoots and lateral shoots. Thirty days later, one to several new shoots developed from each bud eye region. The highest shoot induction rate (100%) was achieved with 1.0 mg L-1 BA and 0.5 mg L-1 GA3 .

The shoots were transferred to the half-strength MS medium with double-strength calcium chloride supplemented with either IBA or IAA at 0.5 or 1.0 mg L-1. The half-strength MS medium supplemented with IBA and IAA showed good number of roots. Reducing the MS salt concentration to a half level was found to be effective in terms of frequency of root induction. However, shoots became slightly withered and leaves turned yellow, probably due to long (30 days) exposure to activated charcoal. New rooting treatments have been developed, examining the effects of plant growth regulators by a short exposure to a solution with a high auxin concentration. Shoots were dipped in the full-strength liquid MS medium supplemented with 10.0 mg L-1 IBA without agar for 5 days and then were transferred to a quarter strength MS medium without any PGR.

At least 30 cubes were used for each treatment. At the end of a subculture cycle we determined both the increase of the number of buds and the multiplication rate, i.e. the number of tubes in a subculture cycle divided by the number of tubes in the previous subculture cycle. Cold treatments (4ºC) before culture had no effect on the number of buds, the shoot length increased 10 fold. The multiplication rate usually varied between 1.3 to 2.9. Shortly after initiation, cultivation at 20ºC was compared to that at 15ºC, in light as well as in the dark. At 20ºC the multiplication rate decreased in 4 subcycles from 2.7 to 0.6. At 15ºC the lowest multiplication rate was 1.33. Therefore all subcultures were done at 15ºC. None of the other factors examined appeared to increase the multiplication rate significantly. In liquid media, the explants elongated but also became vitrified.","The rooting medium was similar to the multiplication medium with the exception for the hormones. Instead of BAP and GA3, auxin was added instead. To be quite certain that the explants were not dormant, all explants received a cold treatment for at least 4 weeks at 4ºC in the dark. Explants of a similar size (2 to 4 buds) were placed on media containing IAA, IBA or NAA in concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/l. All the explants were kept in the dark at 15ºC for the first two weeks, then they were placed in the light. The rooting percentage and the number of roots per rooted shoot were recorded every 2 weeks up to 12 weeks. In a next experiment a wider range of IBA was tested. Other factors examined were: different periods of cold, cultivation temperature, sugar concentration and colour of light. The two lowest concentrations of auxin produced the best results. The first roots appeared 6 weeks after transfer to the rooting media, and up to 10-12 weeks new roots were still being formed. Rooting with IAA or IBA was better then with NAA. At a concentration higher than 0.5 mg/l the explants formed abundantly callus, and the quality of the explants was reduced. However, a low concentration of auxin was required for rooting. The optimal concentration for IBA was approximately 0.1 mg/l. The number and quality of the roots at this concentration was better than at higher concentrations. The effect of varying periods of cold and different cultivation temperatures, was not clear. Saccharose 30 g/l produced the highest rooting percentage. Rooting in the dark was better than rooting in white or red light. Off all the experiments the best result was obtained after 12 weeks on standard medium (0.1 mg/l IBA) at 12.5ºC in the dark (80% rooting).","Rooted plantlets from several rooting experiments were used in acclimatization experiments. After cutting back the shoots of the plantlets to a length of 2-3 cm, they were immerged in a solution of 20 g/l benomyl for 2-4 min. Thereafter they were planted in a mixture of fertilized peat/sand (1:1) or peat/perlite (1:1) in plastic trays with a transparant plastic cover. Cultivation occurred at 5, 10 or 15ºC , at a light intensity 45 µmol/s/m2 (16 hrs per day). The plants were sprayed with fungicide twice a week, any contaminated explants were discarded. In a second experiment the day length (8, 12 or 16 hrs) was varied instead of temperature. To decrease the percentage of infection the plunge in the solution of benomyl was extended to at least 5 min. After planting in soil, more than 50% of the plants was lost due to infection. Growth in peat/ perlite during the first 3-4 weeks was better than in peat/sand. No significant effect of temperature was found. Increased day length during the first 3 weeks resulted in increased shoot length and increased leaf size. With extended weaning, the differences in shoot length disappeared whereas the differences in leaf size remained. The non-infected peonies grew well and the root system developed quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of different basal media and concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on induction were investigated to establish an aseptic regeneration system. The best medium to induce and proliferate shoots was modified half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with double the concentration of Ca2+ supplemented with 1 mg l-1 gibberellic acid (GA3) plus 1 mg l-1 6-benzyladenine (BA). Two successive steps were adopted for rooting shoots. Shoots were first cultured on Woody Plant Medium (WPM) plus 0.5 mg l-1 1-naphthyleneacetic acid (NAA) for 10-15 days in the dark, then shoots were transferred to PGR-free WPM medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal; in this case, rooting could reach 50%. The best explants for callus induction were young stems, and the best basal medium for callus induction was WPM for ‘Da Fu Gui’ and ‘Tao Hua Fei Xue’.",Micropropagation of herbaceous peony,"Three herbaceous cultivars (which have high ornamental value and vigorous growth in vitro) as experimental materials, ‘Zhong Sheng Fen’, ‘Da Fu Gui’ and ‘Tao Hua Fei Xue’.","Four types of explants were investigated in this study: underground buds of ‘Zhong Sheng Fen’, and stems, petioles and leaves of ‘Da Fu Gui’ and ‘Tao Hua Fei Xue’. Underground buds of ‘Zhong Sheng Fen’ were thicker than other cultivars, so they were better for shoot induction, and were thus selected for our study. Buds were collected in winter while other explants were collected in spring. All material was obtained from the Jiu Feng Herbaceous Peony Experimental Base of Beijing Forestry University.","Before inoculating, buds were washed in tap water for 30 min. Outer scales were peeled off and buds were soaked in 75% ethanol for 30 s followed by 15 min of sterilization with a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite (2% active chlorine). Plant material was rinsed three times for 5 min in autoclaved distilled water (ADW). The remaining scales were peeled off, and buds were soaked in a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite (1% active chlorine) for 12 min. The material was rinsed in ADW four times then cultured in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml agar solidified medium with one or two buds per flask. Other explants (i.e., stems, petioles and leaves) were washed in tap water for 30 min and cut into 2-4 cm long sections. Sections were soaked in 75% ethanol for 30 s followed by 15 min sterilization with a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite (0.5% active chlorine). Plant material was rinsed three times, 5 min each, in ADW. After sterilization, explants were cut into shorter (1-2 mm) sections and cultured in Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) containing 30 ml of solidified agar (0.7%) medium. The pH of all media was adjusted to 5.8 prior to autoclaving at 118°C for 18 min. Culture vessels were placed at 25 ± 2°C in a 14-h photoperiod with 50 µmol m-2 s-1 PPFD using cool white fluorescent tubes. For callus induction, cultures were placed in complete darkness. Data were collected after 30 days of culture. To initiate culture, shoot tips of underground buds of ‘Zhong Sheng Fen’ were cultured in half-strength MS medium (doublestrength Ca2+) supplemented with 1 mg l-1 GA3 + 1 mg l-1 BA or 1 mg l-1 GA3 + 1 mg l-1 BA + 0.1 mg l-1 NAA. For callus induction, stems and petioles were cut into 1-2 mm segments. The edges of leaf laminae were trimmed and the remaining leaf tissue was divided into 5 mm2 squares and placed abaxial side down on the surface of media. Explants were cultured on half-strength MS (double-strength Ca2+) or WPM medium supplemented with different PGRs as follows: (1) half-strength MS (double-strength Ca2+) + 2 mg l-1 BA + 0.2 mg l-1 NAA + 0.2 mg l-1 2,4-D; (2) half -strength MS (double-strength Ca2+) + 2 mg l-1 BA + 0.2 mg l-1 NAA; (3) WPM + 2 mg l-1 BA + 0.2 mg l-1 NAA + 0.2 mg l-1 2,4-D; (4) WPM + 2 mg l-1 BA + 0.2 mg l -1 NAA. The growth regulators, concentrations and combinations were selected on the basis of the domestic and foreign researches in tissue culture of peony. After inoculation, yellowish-white buds turned green in the light. The shoots elongated and leaves expanded with the axillary bud sprouting. GA3 (1 mg l-1) + BA (1 mg l-1) stimulated the growth of shoots whose stems were sturdy and leaves were large.","In shoot proliferation culture, vigorous tissue-cultured plants were separated at the base into 2-3 plantlets, and then placed on half-strength MS (doublestrength Ca2+) supplemented with 1 mg l-1 GA3 + 1 mg l-1 BA, 1 mg l-1 GA3 + 0.1 mg l-1 Thidiazuron (TDZ), 1 mg l-1 BA or 0.2 mg l-1 BA. The highest number of axillary shoots (3.9) was obtained on medium with 1 mg l-1 GA3 + 0.1 mg l-1 TDZ, however, TDZ had a negative effect on the growth of shoots, which gradually became abnormal. Leaves were twisted and the plants tended to become hyperhydric. Most of the axillary shoots induced by TDZ could not be used in subsequent culture and proliferation percentage was lowest. TDZ was better than BA for shoot proliferation. The highest proliferation rate (2.3) and good quality (i.e., vigorous growth, strong stems, dark-green leaves) shoots were obtained on medium with 1 mg l-1 GA3 + 1 mg l-1 BA; 1 mg l-1 of BA was more effective than 0.2 mg l-1 in terms of shoot proliferation. GA3 had no significant effect on shoot multiplication.","At the rooting stage, shoots were placed on different rooting medium for 10-15 days, and then transferred to PGR-free WPM medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal (AC). The rooting media were WPM (PGR-free), WPM + 0.5 mg l-1 Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), WPM + 1 mg l-1 NAA, or WPM + 0.5 mg l-1 NAA. The highest rooting percentage (50%) was obtained on medium with 0.5 mg l-1 NAA in which the average root number was 2.3. Even though NAA induced callusing at the base of shoots, roots were not connected to the callus, only to the stems, i.e. adventitious roots. Other media induced lower rooting percentages and fewer roots. Roots could also be induced in auxin-free medium but, among all media, parameters were lowest in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basic processes including culture initiation, shoot induction, axillary shoot proliferation and rooting were established. The best initial medium of ‘Da Fu Gui’ was half-strength MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium (double-strength Ca2+) supplemented with 0.5 mg l-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) plus 0.5 mg l-1 gibberellic acid (GA3). The best medium for axillary shoot induction was half-strength MS medium (double-strength Ca2+) supplemented with 1.0 mg l-1 BA plus 0.5 mg l-1 kinetin (Kin), while 0.5 mg l-1 BA + 0.3 mg l-1 Kin was best for shoot proliferation. Shoot height at the time of inoculation had a great effect on proliferation and growth of ‘Da Fu Gui’. Putrescine (Put) (0.5 to 5.0 mg l-1) prevented rooting of ‘Da Fu Gui’ but it favored the development of roots. Highest rooting percentage was observed on half-strength MS medium (double-strength Ca2+) supplemented with 1 mg l-1 indole-3-butyric acid (IBA).",Micropropagation of herbaceous peony,"An excellent (highly responsive to manipulation) herbaceous cultivar ‘Da Fu Gui’, which is a traditional Chinese variety with high ornamental value and vigorous growth in vitro",Two-year-old underground buds were collected in spring from the Society of Forestry Experimental Station. The buds were about 3 cm in length and were collected between the closed and sprouting stage.,"Before inoculating, underground buds were washed in tap water for 30 min. Outer scales were peeled off and denuded buds were soaked in 75% ethanol for 30 s followed by 10 min sterilization with a dilute solution of HgCl2 (0.1% w/v). Buds were rinsed five times (5 min each time) in autoclaved distilled water, then cultured in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml of agar-solidified medium with one bud per flask. All explants were placed on agar (0.7%) solidified medium. The basal medium for all experiments was 1/2 MS with double-strength calcium chloride (Ca2+) supplemented with 30 g L-1 sucrose. The effect of GA3 (0.5 mg l-1) combined with BA (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg l-1) on initiation culture of ‘Da Fu Gui’ was tested. The pH of all media was adjusted to 5.8 prior to autoclaving at 118°C for 18 min. Culture vessels were placed at 25 ± 2°C in a 14-h photoperiod with 50 μmol m-2s-1 PPFD using cool white fluorescent tubes. Data were collected after 30 days of culture. The explants were subcultured every 30 days. The initiation medium with 0.5 to 1.5 mg l-1 BA favored the growth of underground buds the most, with a 100% sprouting percentage in all three treatments. The highest leaf expansion percentage (96.97%) and height (3.61 cm) was observed with 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 GA3. The slightly higher number of lateral shoots (2.42) and the best growth of shoots were noted on medium containing the lowest concentration of BA (0.5 mg l-1). A higher concentration of BA (2.0 mg l-1) did not further stimulate the growth of shoots, resulting in the lowest sprouting percentage (78.90%), leaf expansion percentage (66.27%) and number of lateral shoots (1.72). In addition, a higher concentration of BA inhibited explant growth, induced hyperhydricity and deformed shoots. Thus, medium containing 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 GA3 was the best choice for initial shoot induction of ‘Da Fu Gui’, considering the higher number (2.28) of lateral shoots.","The effect of different treatments on axillary shoot induction was tested. Shoot induction medium was 1/2 MS + 1.0 mg l-1 BA, 1/2 MS + 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 Kin, 1/2 MS + 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 Kin + 0.1 mg l-1 IBA, 1/2 MS + 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 Kin + 0.1 mg l-1 IAA. There were two experiments for axillary shoot proliferation. Firstly, the effects of different treatments on shoot proliferation were tested. The treatments were 1/2 MS + 0.5 mg l-1 BA + 0.3 mg l-1 Kin, 1/2 MS + 0.5 mg l-1 BA + 0.3 mg l-1 Kin + 500 mg l-1 casein hydrolysate (CH), 1/2 MS + 0.5 mg l-1 BA + 0.3 mg l-1 Kin + 0.2 mg l-1 IBA. Then, the effects of initial height of shoots used in inoculation on the proliferation and growth of ‘Da Fu Gui’ were tested. The shoots were divided into three groups according to height (1, ≤1 cm; 2 = 1 to 2 cm; 3, ≥ 2 cm) before culture. The medium was 1/2 MS supplemented with 0.2 mg l-1 BA or plant growth regulator (PGR)-free 1/2 MS medium. Axillary shoots were able to generate after three weeks of culture. After 20 days of culture, a large number of axillary shoots (about 10) were produced from meristematic regions and from the base of buds. Medium with 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 Kin resulted in the highest shoot induction percentage (58.93%). Most axillary shoots (12.29) and the lowest shoot induction percentage (37.30%) were observed with 1.0 mg l-1 BA. The addition 0.1 mg l-1 IBA or 0.1 mg l-1 IAA to medium containing 1.0 mg l-1 BA and 0.5 mg l-1 Kin decreased the number of axillary shoots. In conclusion, medium containing 1.0 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 Kin favored axillary shoot induction the most. In the case of axillary shoot proliferation, a slightly higher number of multiple shoots (3.3) was obtained on medium with 0.5 mg l-1 BA + 0.3 mg l-1 Kin. The addition of 500 mg l-1 CH or 0.2 mg l-1 IBA did not favor shoot proliferation. Thus, the best proliferation medium for ‘Da Fu Gui’ was 0.5 mg l-1 BA + 0.3 mg l-1 Kin. In the case of the shoot height effect, most leaves (7.95), greatest height (2.96 cm) and percentage of sturdy shoots (79.90%) were obtained in shoots taller than 2 cm cultured on PGR-free 1/2 MS medium. Shoots taller than 2 cm significantly resulted in the best effect followed by shoots 1 to 2 cm in size, then shoots smaller than 1 cm, with or without BA. The addition of BA to medium resulted in poor growth of shoots, gradual hyperhydricity and etiolation. Shoots easily became dormant and fragile in summer because of high humidity, so, even a low concentration of BA (0.2 mg l-1) harmed shoot subculture. Thus, during the hot summer months, shoots taller than 2 cm cultured on PGR-free 1/2 MS medium were optimal for subculture.","In the fifth experiment, the effects of Put (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mg l-1) combined with 1 mg l-1 IBA on root induction of ‘Da Fu Gui’ were tested. At the rooting stage, shoots were placed on different rooting media for 20 days and then transferred to PGR-free 1/2 MS medium containing 0.2% activated charcoal (AC). The shoots used for the proliferation and rooting were 2 cm long except shoots for the rooting induction experiment when the effect of Put was 2.0 mg l-1. Roots were produced at the base of shoot stems after shoots were transferred to PGR-free 1/2 MS medium containing 0.2% AC for 20 days. The highest rooting percentage (28.15%) was observed on medium with 1.0 mg l-1 IBA + 0 mg l-1 Put. Even though the percentage rooting decreased when Put was added, the quality of roots and shoots was good, that is, sturdy and without hyperhydricity. The highest number of roots (4.50), root length (2.07 cm), number of leaves (5.05) and height (2.80 cm) were observed on medium with 1.0 mg l-1 IBA + 2.0 mg l-1 Put. Higher concentrations of Put (3.0 to 5.0 mg l-1) negatively affected root induction. Put thus does not induce roots but enhances rooting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half strength Murashige and Shoog (1962) medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine plus 1 mg/l gibberellic acid promoted formation and growth of axillary buds. Continuous shoot multiplication was achieved by vertically splitting the shoot axis and subsequent division of elongated axillary shoots every 36 days. High frequency (57- 100%) of rooting was obtained on paper- bridge liquid medium supplemented with 1 mg/l indole-3-butyric acid. Half of the rooted plantlet were established on porous soil. Thus, 700 and 300 plants of cv. Takinoyosooi and Sarah Bernhardt could be theoretically obtained from a single bud in one year.",A rapid multiplication method for herbaceous peony,Herbaceous peony cultivars Takinoyosooi and Sarah Bernhardt,early spring buds on the rhizomes,"A few scale leaves were removed and the buds were sterilized in a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite (active chlorine 0.7%) and rinsed with a sterile water two times. Main shoot tips and axillary shoot tips (2-3 mm long) were excised after removal of small scale leaves under a dissecting microscope. The explants were placed on agar (0.8%) solidified medium (15 ml) in test tubes (2 cm ø, 15 cm long). The nutrient medium consisted of half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and Fe-EDTA, Ringe and Nitsch minor elements and vitamins and 3% sucrose at pH 5.6. BAP (0.5 mg/l) plus GA (1 mg/l) were supplemented as growth regulators for the initial culture. All the test tubes were placed at 20 ºC under 16 hr illumination from 52 µEm-2 S-1 cool white fluorescent lamps. Excised shoot tips elongated and formed axillary buds at most nodal positions.","BAP (0.5 mg/l) plus GA (1 mg/l) or only 0.5 mg/l BAP were tested for the subculture. The elongated shoot axes with 3 to 5 axillary buds were then longitudinally split into halves left. Some of the long shoots were further sectioned transversely into two so that four-stem sections were obtained. Here, each section should contain at least one axillary bud. Otherwise, no more mutiplication occurred. The average numbers of split sections obtained in cv. Takinoyosooi was 3.8 shoots, and in cv. Sarah Bernhardt 3.3 shoots. From the next division, 0.5 mg/l BAP single treatment as well as GA and BAP combination treatment was used. Within 35 days after culture, each section developed into shoots (2-3 cm long) and again produced secondary axillary buds at the nodes. Some of the axillary buds elongated and looked like branching shoots in BAP and GA combination treatment in both cultivars. From this time on, multiplication was achieved only by division of axillary shoots. About 33 days after culture, axillary buds elongated to 2-4 cm long with new axillary buds in both cultivars. Again, shoot division was achieved. This continued division was possible at 36 day intervals at least upto 5 times without losing the capacity of axillary bud formation in both cultivars. The number of divided shoots and the number of elongated axillary shoots were somewhat greater in BAP and GA combination medium than in BAP single treatment. In BAP treated shoots, many minute axillary buds were observed around the nodal area at the lower stem position. These bud aggregates were morphologically similar to those on underground rhizome or crown grown in the field. If this division was repeated in BAP plus GA medium at 36 day intervals for one year including the time for initial shoot elongation (2-3 months), more than 5000 shoots could be theoretically obtained from a single bud. This number is similar to that in multiplication of Japanese horseradish for which a similar shoot split method was developed. This multiplication method is much easier and more practical, compared with that of somatic embryogenesis from callus of seed embryo.","For rooting, shoot (2-3 cm long) was transferred to 0.1 mg/l or 1 mg/l of NAA and IBA supplemented agar solidified medium. The 0.1 mg/l of both auxins produced roots only in 0-40% of the shoots in both cultivars whereas 1 mg/l of them produced roots in 40-80% of the shoots but it took over 3 months (data not shown). Therefore, paper-bridge method on liquid culture was adopted to expose stem-base to more oxygen. One mg/l of NAA or IBA was again used. Within 2 months. 100% IBA treated shoots produced roots in cv. Takinoyosooi and 57% in cv. Sarah Bernhardt. NAA produced roots in 40% and 70% of the plants, respectively, but it also produced callus at the stem-base, which caused tissue decay by fungus attack after ex vitro culture. IBA treated plantlets with roots were transferred to a porous soil medium under plastic cover at 18- 20ºC under 16 hr illumination from 52 µEm-2s-1 cool white fluorescent lamps. More than half of shoots were established. The remaining plants turned yellow. Such an incomplete establishment may be due to lift-up of the shoots above paper- bridge as the roots grew down during culture. Therefore, nutrient absorption became insufficient. Such a problem is being resolved by placing shreds of gauze about 4mm thick on the paper- bridge where roots penetrate into medium and good aeration is maintained. Although more efficient acclimatization after ex vitro culture must be established, we have demonstrated a clonal propagation system of commercial cultivars of Paeonia lactiflora by a shoot splitting method and subsequent division of axillary shoots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For other species, storage organ formation in vitro can limit the loss of plants during acclimatization. In the natural conditions, the renewal buds for the following year originate on the underground crown (metamorphosed underground shoot, rhizome) of herbaceous peony. A perennial crown and roots serve for the accumulation of the storage products and plant renewal. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the influence of glucose (30, 60, 90 g l-1) and growth regulators (kinetin, IBA, GA3) on the shoot, renewal bud, root growth and development of Paeonia lactiflora 'Jadwiga’ in vitro. Excision of all leaves from isolated explants inhibited production of new shoots and leaves, and evidently induced formation of renewal buds. Increasing the glucose supply, especially in the absence of growth regulators, decreased production of shoots and outgrowth of leaves. The stronger inhibition of shoot growth by glucose was observed on the explants without leaves. By contrast, the beneficial effect of glucose on renewal bud formation was observed. A single supply of kinetin, IBA or GA3 stimulated shoots and leaf growth and inhibited renewal bud formation, on the explants isolated with leaves. Interaction of kinetin, GA3 and IBA (added together) and the highest glucose level enhanced the growth of shoots on the explants containing leaves, and increased the number of renewal buds, on the explants without leaves. Increasing glucose level enhanced the number of roots in the absence of growth regulators on the explants containing leaves. The supply of IBA in the medium containing 30 g l-1 glucose, stimulated the root production on the explants without leaves. The addition of GA3 or kinetin (singly or simultaneously with IBA) to the medium with different concentrations of glucose, strongly inhibited rooting. The results presented here, show that a high level of glucose and exogenous growth regulators (kinetin, GA3, IBA) together stimulate shoot and renewal bud formation but the way of organogenesis depends on the presence or absence of leaves. The interaction between auxin (exogenous or endogenous) and glucose regulate root formation on the peony shoots but the final effect depends on the type of explants (with or without leaves). It is possible that leaves have a very important hormonal factors, which stimulate shoot growth or rooting and inhibit renewal bud formation.","To investigate the influence of glucose (30, 60, 90 gl-1) and growth regulators (kinetin, IBA, GA3) on the shoot, renewal bud, root growth and development of Paeonia lactiflora ’Jadwiga’ in vitro",Paeonia lactiflora ’Jadwiga’,The pieces of crown with one shoot (with or without leaves) excised from Paeonia lactiflora 'Jadwiga' propagated on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing kinetin 1 mgl-1 + 2iP 1 mgl-1 + BAP 1 mgl-1 + TDZ 0.01 mgl-1 and sucrose 30 gl-1.,Plant material used for the experiment (Paeonia lactiflora ‘Jadwiga’) was propagated on the MS medium containing: kinetin 1 mgl-1 + 2iP 1 mgl-1 + BAP 1 mgl-1 + TDZ 0.01 mgl-1 and sucrose 30 gl-1,"Two different inocula (the pieces of crown with one shoot with or without leaves) were used. The influence of glucose (30, 60, 90 gl-1) and kinetin 1 mgl-1, GA3 1 mgl-1, IBA 1 mgl-1 (added to the medium alone or together) on the shoot, renewal bud and root formation was investigated. Culture conditions were a 16 h photoperiod provided by coolwhite fluorescent lamps (Philips TLD 36W/95) at 80 μmolm-2s-1 and a temperature of 25 °C. Excision of all leaves promoted the renewal bud formation in the absence of exgenous growth regulators as well as in their presence in the medium. The renewal bud formation was induced by glucose on a growth regulator-free medium. Interaction of all growth regulator (kinetin, GA3, IBA added together) and high glucose level induced renewal bud formation (about 4.5/inoculum), on the inocula without leaves. The addition of 1 mgl-1 kinetin, IBA or GA3 (singly or together) inhibited renewal bud formation on the inocula with leaves.","Leaves as the source of endogenous growth regulators influenced root formation. Inocula with leaves produced roots on the growth regulator-free medium but with the presence of glucose. Increasing glucose level strongly enhanced the number of roots (from 0.4 to 2.6 roots/inoculum) in the absence of grwoth regulators, on the inoculum with leaves. But the addition of GA3 or kinetin to the medium with different concentrations of glucose strongly inhibited rhizogenesis. Also, the presence of GA3 and kinetin (added together) in the IBA-containing medium significantly suppressed the rooting on the both kinds of inocula. The excision of leaves and supply of IBA (1 mgl-1) promoted rhozogenesis (3 roots/inoculum) on the shoots growing at the lowest concentration of glucse (30 gl-1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plantlet growth increased with an increasing number of air exchanges of the culture vessel, exhibiting greatest shoot weight, total fresh weight, leaf area, and chlorophyll content at 4.4 h−1 of air exchanges. High sucrose concentration (30 g l−1) increased root weight but reduced shoot growth. Net photosynthetic rates of the plantlets were greatest when sucrose was not added to the medium. On the other hand, ex vitro survival of the plantlets was not influenced by sucrose concentration. In the experiment on difference in photoperiod and dark period temperatures (DIF) and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), plantlet growth increased as DIF and PPF levels increased. Particularly, increasing PPF level had a more distinctive effect on plantlet growth than increasing DIF level. The interaction of DIF × PPF was also significant, showing the greatest plantlet growth in positive DIF (+8 DIF) and a high PPF (210 μmol m−2 s−1). In conclusion, the results of this experiment suggest that increased number of air exchanges of the culture vessel, decreased sucrose concentration, and positive DIF in combination with high PPF level enhanced growth and acclimatization of Rehmannia glutinosa plantlets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because ginger does not reproduce by seed, but is clonally propagated via rhizome division and replanting, it is susceptible to accumulation and transmittance of pathogens from generation to genration. In addition, such propagation techniques lead to slow multiplication of particularly useful stocks. We have developed an in vitro propagation method to alleviate these problems. Metabolic profiling, using GC/MS and LC-ESI-MS, was used to determine if chemical differences existed between greenhouse grown or in vitro micropropagation derived plants. Three different ginger lines were analysed. The constituent gingerols and gingerol-related compounds, othe diarylheptanoids, and methyl ether derivatives of these compounds, as well as major mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed chemical differences between lines(yellow ginger vs. white ginger and blue ring ginger) and tissues(rhizome, root, leaf and shoot). However, this analysis indicated that no significant differences existed between growth treatments(conventional greenhouse grown vs. in vitro propagation derived plants). Further statistical analyses(ANOVA) confirmed these results. These findings suggest that the biochemical mechanisms used to produce the large array of compounds found in ginger are not affected by in vitro propagation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Place and Duration of Study: The entire study was conducted in plant tissue culture research unit of the Department of Export Agriculture, Walpita, Sri Lanka between November 2013 and August 2015. Methodology: In-vitro produced shoots established in hormone free medium were cultured in Murashige and Skoog (1962) (MS) medium fortified with eight treatments of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.0, 2.0, 0.4 and 6.0 mg L-1 of BAP) and Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) (0.1 and 0.2 mg L-1 of NAA) structuring in factorial design to study the effect of growth regulators for formation of microrhizomes. In-vitro produced shoots were cultured on MS medium fortified with different concentration of sucrose (30, 60, 90 and 120gL-1) separately.
